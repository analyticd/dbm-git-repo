# dbm-git-repo
DBM's legacy support code for blockchain

For now the dbm-legacy-support folder contains the Lisp source for all the support routines beneath new Emotiq code. It is only partially ported to ACL at this time. Work on porting contines here.

The Emotiq folder contains new code written expressly for the Emotiq blockchain effort.
