;; ------------------
;; CCAS - Conditional CAS
;;
;; The job of CCAS is to conditionally acquire a reference on behalf
;; of an MCAS operation. The condition is that the MCAS operation must
;; still be in a state of :UNDECIDED.
;;
;; If this condition is met, we either acquire the ref cell with the
;; MCAS descriptor, or we fail because the ref cell did not contain
;; the expected old value
;;
;; If the CCAS acquires, but the condition is not met, it can only be
;; because another thread pushed us along to a :FAILED or :SUCCEEDED
;; resolution already. In other words we have already been through
;; here.  So even if we successfuly CAS again, we have to set the
;; value back to Old value.
