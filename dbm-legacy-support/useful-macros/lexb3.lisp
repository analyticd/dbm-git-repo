;; The macro ENSURE-LEXICAL-BINDING in this version accomplishes its
;; actions by way of alpha conversion of the body code over the
;; detected global references obtained by code-walking the body form.
;;
;; Lexical bindings are assured by using uninterned symbols as
;; replacements for extant binding names. That way, unlike with
;; symbol-macrolet, extant global special values can exist without
;; signaling an error during compiling. The current runtime binding
;; values of global symbols will be picked up and bound lexically to
;; uninterned symbols which cannot possibly be already globally bound.
;;
;; The scanning and rewriting is accomplished with the help of the LW
;; Walker.
