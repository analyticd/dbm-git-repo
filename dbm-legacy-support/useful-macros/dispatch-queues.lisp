;;
;; Serial and Parallel Dispatch
;;
;; Groups are defined implicitly on dispatch queues, as well as by
;; user group names. Waiting on a dispatch group allows for selective
;; waits when numerous, possibly unrelated, groups of tasks are
;; launched in parallel.
;;
;; Waiting on a queue, as contrasted with waiting on a group, implies
;; waiting until all tasks on the queue have been finalized,
;; regardless of group assignments.
;;
;; Dispatch can be Serial or Parallel, Synchronous or Asynchronous.
;; All four combinations are defined: DISPATCH-SERIAL-SYNC,
;; DISPATCH-SERIAL-ASYNC, DISPATCH-PARALLEL-SYNC, and
;; DISPATCH-PARALLEL-ASYNC.  
;;
;; Serial dispatch implies a serialized ordering of tasks on a queue,
;; but operate in parallel with the caller thread. Serial dispatch
;; queues operate in parallel with each other and the (implicit)
;; parallel dispatch queue. Serial dispatch queues can be created by
;; the user to segregate groups of tasks, but NIL refers to the
;; default serial dispatch queue, created on demand.
;;
;; All parallel dispatches, as opposed to serial dispatches, are
;; conceptually grouped as one default multi-headed queue, and imply
;; no serialized ordering to the dispatched tasks.
;;
;; Synchronous dispatch implies a wait for results, so parallelism
;; with the caller ceases until the task completes. The task can be
;; launched on either a serial dispatch queue, which implies a
;; serialized ordering among tasks in the queue, and the reply will
;; occur only after the launched synchronous task has its chance to
;; run to completion after arriving at the head of the queue. Or else
;; a task can be launched with parallel dispatch, which implies
;; immediate and arbitrary ordering of the task, with the response
;; arriving whenever the task has its chance to run.
;;
;; Asynchronous dispatch fires off a task in parallel, and any results
;; from the task are discarded. Dispatch can occur on a serial queue,
;; or on the (implicit) parallel dispatch queue. The same remarks
;; about task ordering apply here.
;;
;; Final synchronization among launched tasks can be had with
;; WAIT-FOR-SERIAL-DISPATCH, WAIT-FOR-PARALLEL-DISPATCH, and
;; WAIT-FOR-DISPATCH-GROUP. The first two functions accept an optional
;; group or queue argument.
;;
;; For parallel dispatch, no argument in WAIT-FOR-PARALLEL-DISPATCH
;; implies a wait for all parallel dispatched activity to complete. A
;; group argument implies a wait for those tasks which were dispatched
;; with that group assignment, regardless of how they were dispatched.
;;
;; For serial dispatch, no argument in WAIT-FOR-SERIAL-DISPATCH
;; implies a wait on all tasks assigned to the default serial dispatch
;; queue. A queue argument implies a wait on all tasks assigned to
;; that queue, and a group name argument implies a wait on all tasks
;; dispatched in that group, regardless of how they were dispatched.
;;
;; Tasks may be launched, for any given group ID, into any combination
;; of serial and parallel dispatches. When a specific group can be specified,
;; use the WAIT-FOR-DISPATCH-GROUP and the group ID as argument.
;;
;; Group ID's can be anything that compares EQ. We suggest a keyword symbol.
